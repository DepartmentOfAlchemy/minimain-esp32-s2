PCB files for the MiniMain ESP32-S2 in an Adafruit Feather compatible format.

### Description

This Feather-shaped main board contains an ESP32-S2 for the main microcontroller. It contains 4 MB of flash + 2 MB of PSRAM along with native USB.

This board is designed for use in haunted attraction props as it includes an optoisolated input that allows it to be triggered by another prop controller operating at 12V. This is where the MiniMain deviates from a standard Adafruit Feather: it does not include support for battery operation. (There is also one additional pin broken out in standard 2.54mm pitch format designed for a servo.)
